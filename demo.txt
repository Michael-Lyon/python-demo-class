Technology, oh how you've grown,
From humble beginnings, to now well-known,
You connect us all, from miles away,
And make our lives easier every day.

From phones in our pockets, to screens on our walls,
Our world is filled with your digital calls,
You automate tasks, and store our data,
And help us learn, in a world that's greater.

But with your power, comes responsibility,
To use you for good, with transparency,
To protect our privacy, and our human right,
To use you wisely, with all our might.

Technology, you're changing our lives,
For better or worse, the future arrives,
May we embrace you, with open minds,
And use you to build, a world that shines.
